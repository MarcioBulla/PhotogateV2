# Photogate V2

**Version 2 of the Photogate** â€” implemented with **ESP-IDF v5.4.2** for an ESP32-based photogate project.

---

## Overview

This is the second version of the **Photogate** project, featuring significant improvements in accuracy, reliability, and visual interface, along with available 3D models and schematics.  
Designed for educational and experimental applications using the ESP32 platform.

---

## Requirements

- **ESP-IDF v5.4.2**
- A configured ESP32 development environment (terminal toolchain)
- Required cables and hardware to flash the firmware

---

## Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marciobulla/photogateV2.git
   cd photogateV2
    ```

2. Set up the ESP-IDF environment
   Follow the [Get Started with ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf) guide.

3. Build, flash, and monitor:

   ```bash
   idf.py build
   idf.py flash
   idf.py monitor
    ```

   This will compile the project, upload it to your ESP32, and open the serial monitor.
